# PupAlert-android
The social networking app for finding dogs.


## Building the app

Download and install android studio.

Download this source code as a zip, install into android studio workspace.

Go to File->Import, you should be able to select PupAlert-android.

Android studio will do its thing, it should download/build all dependencies.

Plug your phone in, and click the "Launch" button in android studio.

To get maps to work, copy the debug.keystore to your .android folder, relplacing the old one.

## Using Pup-Alert

When Pup-alert android hits beta, we will have builds in the "releases" tab of github.

To use the app, you can create a new post on the bottom. Take a picture of a dog you see in public!

If you click the map, you will see markers of other dogs all around you! These markers are real time. You can tap the markers for a view of the post.

If you click the feed icon on the nav bar, you will have a real-time feed of posts from dogs within a 15 mile radius!
